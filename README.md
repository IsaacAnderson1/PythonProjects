### Programs Included

- **Clicker**: A program that clicks on a target from an online game whenever the target is on screen. The program's goal was to test how efficient the program could be. This was measured based on the score the program would receive from the game that increased in speed as the game went on.

- **AFK**: This program clicks the left mouse button down every 5 seconds to simulate that a person is at their computer. This could be utilized to keep your computer awake while you are gone.
